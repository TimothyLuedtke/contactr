## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Passport.js, bcrypt, Bootstrap

The back-end was build using Node.js and the Express framework to handle all routes and controller logic. We used EJS as our templating engine for the View, MongoDB & Mongoose for our database and Model logic, Passport.js to handle authentication, bcrypt to salt and hash user passwords, and Bootstrap to style the front-end.
